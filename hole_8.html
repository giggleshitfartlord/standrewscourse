                <ul>
                    <li>Par: 3</li>
                    <li>Length: 175 yards</li>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The first par 3 on the course appears straightforward but can be treacherous in windy conditions. 
                The green is protected by three deep pot bunkers, including the famous Short Hole bunker, which has 
                ruined many scorecards over the centuries.</p>

                <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take plenty of club - the hole often plays longer than yardage</li>
                    <li>Short Hole bunker must be avoided at all costs</li>
                    <li>Use the right-to-left slope to access tough pin positions</li>
                    <li>Factor in the ever-present wind off the Eden Estuary</li>
                    <li>Missing long is better than short</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>The 8th hole, while the shortest on the course, has been the scene of many dramatic moments in 
                championship play. The Short Hole bunker has been in play since the earliest days of golf at St Andrews 
                and remains one of the course's most feared hazards.</p>

            <div class="hole-card mt-4">
                <h3>Common Hazards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Short Hole bunker (front)</li>
                    <li>Two deep pot bunkers (left and right)</li>
                    <li>Collection area behind green</li>
                    <li>Prevailing crosswind</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="hole-card mt-4">
                <h3>Green Reading</h3>
                <p>The green slopes generally from right to left with a subtle ridge running through its center. The 
                surface is relatively small for the Old Course but features typical subtle breaks. Back pin positions 
                can be particularly challenging due to the collection area behind.</p>
