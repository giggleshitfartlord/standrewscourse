                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The final hole of the outward nine presents an interesting strategic challenge. Named "End" as it 
                was traditionally the conclusion of the outward journey, this hole features the fearsome End Hole bunker 
                and a shared green with the 9th.</p>

                <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Favor the left side off the tee to open up the green</li>
                    <li>End Hole bunker must be considered on approach</li>
                    <li>Green slopes significantly from back to front</li>
                    <li>Watch for players on the adjacent fairway</li>
                    <li>Consider running approach shots using the contours</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>The 9th hole marked the furthest point from the clubhouse in the original course routing. In the 
                early days, golfers would often stop here for refreshments before beginning their return journey, 
                establishing a tradition that continues today at many courses worldwide.</p>
