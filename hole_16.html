                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The 16th hole marks the beginning of one of golf's most famous closing stretches. Named for 
                the old stone wall that once marked the course boundary, this hole requires careful positioning 
                off the tee to set up the approach to a well-guarded green.</p>

                <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Principal's Nose bunkers must be negotiated off tee</li>
                    <li>Left side of fairway provides best angle to green</li>
                    <li>Approach plays slightly uphill - take extra club</li>
                    <li>Green slopes significantly from back to front</li>
                    <li>Consider wind effect on approach shot</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>The Principal's Nose bunkers got their name from their resemblance to the nose of a former 
                St Andrews University principal. These distinctive bunkers have been a key strategic feature of 
                the hole since the earliest days of championship golf at St Andrews.</p>

                <h3>Common Hazards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Principal's Nose bunkers (fairway)</li>
                    <li>Deep greenside bunkers</li>
                    <li>Out of bounds (right)</li>
                    <li>Severe green slopes</li>

                <h3>Green Reading</h3>
                <p>The green features some of the most severe slopes on the course, particularly from back to front. 
                A ridge running through the middle creates distinct tiers, making two-putting from the wrong level 
                extremely challenging. The surface is typically firm and fast.</p>
