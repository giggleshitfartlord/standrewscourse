                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The Road Hole is arguably the most famous par 4 in golf. The blind tee shot over the Old Course Hotel 
                leads to a narrow fairway, with the infamous Road Hole Bunker guarding the front left of the green and 
                the stone wall and road lurking behind.</p>

                <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aim over the "O" in "Hotel" on the shed for the ideal line</li>
                    <li>The further right the tee shot, the better angle for approach</li>
                    <li>Avoid the Road Hole Bunker at all costs</li>
                    <li>Better to miss long than short-left</li>
                    <li>Consider laying up if out of position</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>The Road Hole has been the scene of many dramatic moments in golf history, including Tom Watson's 
                costly bogey in 1984 and Costantino Rocca's bunker struggles in 1995. The Road Hole Bunker is so 
                deep and penal it's been nicknamed "The Sands of Nakajima" after Tommy Nakajima's struggles there 
                in the 1978 Open.</p>

                <h3>Common Hazards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Road Hole Bunker (front-left of green)</li>
                    <li>The Road (behind green)</li>
                    <li>Stone wall</li>
                    <li>Out of bounds (right)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Green Reading</h3>
                <p>The green slopes significantly from front-right to back-left, making approach shots from the right 
                side of the fairway particularly challenging. The surface is relatively small and firm, with the road 
                and wall influencing strategy on nearly every pin position.</p>
