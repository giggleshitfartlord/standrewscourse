                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>One of the most demanding holes on the inward nine, the 13th requires both length and accuracy. 
                Named for its crossing point with the 5th hole, it features the infamous Coffin bunkers and a 
                challenging approach to a well-protected green.</p>

                <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strong drive needed - often plays into prevailing wind</li>
                    <li>Coffin bunkers must be avoided off the tee</li>
                    <li>Watch for players crossing from 5th hole</li>
                    <li>Green complex rewards running approach shots</li>
                    <li>Long iron approach common - take enough club</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>The 13th hole has long been considered one of the sternest tests on the Old Course. The Coffin 
                bunkers, aptly named for their ability to 'bury' a player's chances, have influenced the outcome of 
                many Open Championships played here.</p>

                <h3>Common Hazards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coffin bunkers (left)</li>
                    <li>Lion's Mouth bunker (front of green)</li>
                    <li>Shared fairway with 5th hole</li>
                    <li>Pot bunkers around green</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="hole-card mt-4">
                <h3>Green Reading</h3>
                <p>The green is shared with the 5th hole and features significant undulation. A large swale in the 
                middle affects most putts, and the surface tends to be particularly firm. Front pin positions are 
                especially challenging due to the Lion's Mouth bunker.</p>
