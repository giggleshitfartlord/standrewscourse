                <ul>
                    <li>Par: 3</li>
                    <li>Length: 174 yards</li>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>This challenging par 3 plays to an elevated green that's shared with the 7th hole. The Hill bunker 
                guards the front of the green, while Strath bunker protects the right side, making club selection and 
                accuracy paramount.</p>

                <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take enough club to clear the Hill bunker</li>
                    <li>Left side of green is safest play</li>
                    <li>Factor in the elevated green when choosing club</li>
                    <li>Use the slope behind the green as backstop</li>
                    <li>Consider wind effect on the exposed green</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>The Strath bunker was named after David Strath, one of the great players of the 1870s who 
                had a famous rivalry with Young Tom Morris. The bunker has been a key feature of this hole since 
                the earliest days of the Old Course.</p>

                <h3>Common Hazards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hill bunker (front)</li>
                    <li>Strath bunker (right)</li>
                    <li>Elevated green complex</li>
                    <li>Severe slopes around green</li>

                <h3>Green Reading</h3>
                <p>The large double green shared with the 7th hole features significant contours throughout. A ridge 
                running through the middle creates distinct sections, and the surface tends to be very firm. Back-to-front 
                slope can make putting treacherous in fast conditions.</p>
