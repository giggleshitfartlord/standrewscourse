                <p>The first par 5 on the course presents a genuine three-shot hole for most players. Named for its 
                crossing point with the 13th hole, this challenging hole features the notorious Seven Sisters bunkers 
                along its right side.</p>

                <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aim left of center from the tee to avoid the Seven Sisters</li>
                    <li>Second shot should favor the left side</li>
                    <li>Watch for players crossing from the 13th hole</li>
                    <li>The green is well-protected - approach with caution</li>
                    <li>Lay up short of Spectacles bunkers if not going for green in two</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>The Seven Sisters bunkers were reportedly named after seven local washerwomen who worked near 
                this part of the course. These deep pot bunkers have been challenging golfers for centuries and 
                remain some of the most feared hazards on the Old Course.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Seven Sisters bunkers (right side)</li>
                    <li>Spectacles bunkers (approach)</li>
                    <li>Shared fairway with 13th hole</li>
                    <li>Out of bounds (far right)</li>

                <h3>Green Reading</h3>
                <p>The green is shared with the 13th hole and features significant undulations. A large swale in 
                the middle creates distinct sections, making club selection crucial. The surface tends to be faster 
                from back to front, particularly in summer conditions.</p>
