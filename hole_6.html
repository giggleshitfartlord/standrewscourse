                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Named for the heather that once grew abundantly here, this hole features one of the most challenging 
                tee shots on the front nine. The Coffins bunkers lurk on the left side of the fairway, while Heathery 
                bunker guards the right side of the green.</p>

                <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thread your tee shot between the Coffins and the right rough</li>
                    <li>Right side of fairway provides best angle to most pin positions</li>
                    <li>Watch for players coming down the 12th fairway</li>
                    <li>Consider the wind's effect on your approach - the green is exposed</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>The Coffins bunkers earned their name from their rectangular shape and their ability to effectively 
                'bury' a player's chances in a tournament. The heather that gave the hole its name was gradually 
                replaced by traditional links grasses over centuries of play.</p>

                <h3>Common Hazards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coffins bunkers (left)</li>
                    <li>Heathery bunker (right of green)</li>
                    <li>Cap bunker (short right)</li>
                    <li>Shared fairway with 12th hole</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="hole-card mt-4">
                <h3>Green Reading</h3>
                <p>This green is shared with the 12th hole and features subtle breaks throughout. A gentle slope from 
                back to front makes putting from above the hole particularly challenging. The green's firm surface 
                often requires a running approach shot.</p>
