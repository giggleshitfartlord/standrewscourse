            <h2>Early History</h2>
            <p>Golf has been played over the St Andrews links since around 1400 AD, making it one of the oldest golf sites in the world. 
            The game grew in popularity and by 1457, King James II of Scotland banned golf because it was distracting young men from 
            their archery practice - essential for national defense.</p>

            <h2>Evolution of the Course</h2>
            <p>Originally, the course was played in a counter-clockwise direction, with golfers playing to the same holes going out and coming in. 
            In 1764, the course was reduced from 22 holes to 18, creating what became the standard round of golf we know today.</p>
