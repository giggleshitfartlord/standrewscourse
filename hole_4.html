                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>A challenging par 4 that plays directly into the prevailing wind. Named after the ginger beer stand 
                that once stood near the green, this hole features a series of bunkers known as "Students" that guard 
                the right side of the fairway.</p>

                <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take enough club - the hole often plays longer than the yardage</li>
                    <li>Avoid the "Students" bunkers on the right</li>
                    <li>Left side of fairway provides the best angle to the green</li>
                    <li>The green is shared with the 14th hole</li>
                    <li>Consider laying up if out of position</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>The "Students" bunkers got their name because they were supposedly dug by university students 
                in the early days of the course. The ginger beer stand that gave the hole its name was a popular 
                refreshment stop for golfers in the late 19th century.</p>

                <h3>Common Hazards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Students" bunkers (right side)</li>
                    <li>Deep greenside bunkers</li>
                    <li>Shared double green</li>
                    <li>Out of bounds (far right)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Green Reading</h3>
                <p>The large double green slopes generally from back to front with a significant ridge running through 
                its middle. The left portion tends to be more receptive to approach shots, while the right side features 
                more subtle breaks that can be difficult to read.</p>
