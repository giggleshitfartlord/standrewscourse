                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The second hole at the Old Course presents a challenging dogleg right that demands careful strategy. 
                Named "High" due to its elevated green complex, this hole requires precise placement off the tee and an 
                accurate approach shot.</p>

                <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Favor the left side of the fairway off the tee</li>
                    <li>Beware of the Cheape bunkers on the right side</li>
                    <li>The green is elevated and well-protected - take enough club</li>
                    <li>Consider the wind direction carefully on approach</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>The second hole was originally called "Dyke" due to a stone wall that once ran along the right side 
                of the fairway. While the wall is long gone, the strategic challenge of the hole remains intact.</p>

                <h3>Common Hazards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cheape bunkers (right side)</li>
                    <li>Deep greenside bunkers</li>
                    <li>Out of bounds (right)</li>
                    <li>Elevated green complex</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="hole-card mt-4">
                <h3>Green Reading</h3>
                <p>The second green slopes predominantly from back to front with a subtle tier in the middle section. 
                The elevated position makes it particularly susceptible to wind effects. Front pin positions can be 
                especially challenging due to the false front.</p>
