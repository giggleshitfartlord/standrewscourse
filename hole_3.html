                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Cartgate presents a challenging dogleg right that demands accuracy off the tee. The hole features 
                the Cartgate bunkers on the right side of the fairway and a well-protected green complex that tests 
                both strategy and skill.</p>

                <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A drawn tee shot from right to left is ideal</li>
                    <li>Avoid the Cartgate bunkers at all costs</li>
                    <li>The green is shared with the 15th hole</li>
                    <li>Consider the wind direction for your approach</li>
                    <li>Front pin positions are particularly challenging</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>The name "Cartgate" comes from the path that once allowed carts to access the beach for collecting 
                seaweed, which was used to fertilize the links land. The hole has remained largely unchanged since the 
                early days of golf at St Andrews.</p>

                <h3>Common Hazards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cartgate bunkers (right side)</li>
                    <li>Deep greenside bunkers</li>
                    <li>Shared double green</li>
                    <li>Out of bounds (right)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="hole-card mt-4">
                <h3>Green Reading</h3>
                <p>The large double green shared with the 15th hole features subtle contours throughout. A ridge running 
                through the middle of the green creates distinct sections, making distance control crucial. The surface 
                tends to be firmer near the front, making running approaches a viable option.</p>
