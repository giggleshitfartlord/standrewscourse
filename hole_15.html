                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>A challenging par 4 that plays towards the town, Cartgate In features a narrow driving corridor 
                and one of the most challenging approach shots on the course. The hole is named after the cart path 
                that once crossed the fairway here.</p>

                <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thread tee shot between bunkers left and right</li>
                    <li>Miss the approach left rather than right</li>
                    <li>Consider running approach shot onto green</li>
                    <li>Factor in cross-winds on approach</li>
                    <li>Green shared with 3rd hole - check pin position</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>The name "Cartgate" refers to the ancient path used by carts to transport seaweed from the beach 
                for use as fertilizer on local farms. This hole has been a pivotal test in many Open Championships, 
                particularly when playing into the prevailing wind.</p>

                <h3>Common Hazards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cartgate bunkers (right)</li>
                    <li>Miss Miss bunker (left)</li>
                    <li>Pot bunkers near green</li>
                    <li>Out of bounds (right)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="hole-card mt-4">
                <h3>Green Reading</h3>
                <p>The double green shared with the 3rd hole features subtle contours throughout. A ridge running 
                through the middle creates distinct sections, and the surface tends to be very firm. Back-right pin 
                positions are particularly challenging.</p>
