                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The opening hole at the Old Course is one of golf's most iconic starting holes. A relatively wide fairway is 
                bounded by the Swilcan Burn on the right and out of bounds along the first and eighteenth fairways.</p>

                <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aim slightly left of center from the tee to avoid the Swilcan Burn</li>
                    <li>The fairway is shared with the 18th hole - be aware of players coming in</li>
                    <li>A medium iron or hybrid off the tee is often sufficient</li>
                    <li>The green is protected by deep bunkers - approach with caution</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>The Swilcan Burn that crosses the first and 18th holes has been a feature of the course since its earliest 
                days, originally helping to drain the land that would become the Old Course.</p>

                <h3>Common Hazards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Swilcan Burn (right side)</li>
                    <li>Out of bounds (left side)</li>
                    <li>Greenside bunkers</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="hole-card mt-4">
                <h3>Green Reading</h3>
                <p>The first green is relatively flat by Old Course standards but has subtle breaks that can be difficult 
                to read. The surface tends to slope slightly from back to front.</p>
