                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>The 18th has witnessed countless historic moments, including Jack Nicklaus' farewell to professional golf 
                in 2005 and Arnold Palmer's emotional goodbye in 1995. The Valley of Sin has played a crucial role in many 
                championships, most notably Costantino Rocca's incredible putt in the 1995 Open Championship.</p>
