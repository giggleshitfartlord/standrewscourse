                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Named in honor of the legendary Bobby Jones, who won the Grand Slam in 1930, this hole marks the 
                beginning of the inward nine. A strategic par 4 that demands accuracy off the tee to set up the 
                approach to a well-protected green.</p>

                <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aim left of Kruger bunkers for ideal approach angle</li>
                    <li>Bobby Jones bunker must be avoided on second shot</li>
                    <li>Green slopes severely from back to front</li>
                    <li>Consider the wind direction - often plays downwind</li>
                    <li>Conservative play to center of green is often wise</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>Bobby Jones had a special relationship with St Andrews, despite walking off the course in frustration 
                during his first visit in 1921. He would later return to win the 1927 Open Championship here and be 
                given the Freedom of St Andrews, only the second American to receive this honor.</p>

                <h3>Common Hazards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Kruger bunkers (right)</li>
                    <li>Bobby Jones bunker (front left)</li>
                    <li>Steep green-to-front slope</li>
                    <li>Hidden swale behind green</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Green Reading</h3>
                <p>The green is shared with the 8th hole and features a pronounced ridge running diagonally across 
                its surface. The back-to-front slope can be severe, making approach shots from above the hole 
                particularly challenging. Many subtle breaks affect putts, especially in the front portion.</p>
