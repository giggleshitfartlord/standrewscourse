                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>A classic risk-reward par 4 that tempts players to challenge the Shell bunkers off the tee. 
                The hole plays to an elevated green complex that's shared with the 11th hole, making precise 
                distance control essential.</p>

                <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conservative play left of Shell bunkers is safest</li>
                    <li>Aggressive line over bunkers possible with favorable wind</li>
                    <li>Approach shot must account for elevated green</li>
                    <li>Short is better than long on approach</li>
                    <li>Consider using the bank short-right of green</li>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>The Shell bunkers were named for the numerous seashells found when they were originally excavated, 
                a reminder that the Old Course was once beneath the sea. These bunkers have influenced strategy here 
                since golf was first played at St Andrews.</p>

                <h3>Green Reading</h3>
                <p>The elevated double green features significant undulations and a pronounced tier that separates the 
                7th and 11th hole pin positions. The surface is particularly firm, making it difficult to hold approach 
                shots, especially in dry conditions.</p>
