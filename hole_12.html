                <h3>Hole Overview</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Par: 4</li>
                    <li>Length: 348 yards</li>
                    <li>Stroke Index: 9</li>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>This relatively short par 4 requires strategic thinking rather than power. The Stroke bunker 
                guards the optimal line to the green, while a series of pot bunkers protect the putting surface. 
                The hole shares its name with the 6th, referencing the heather that once grew here.</p>

                    <li>Position off tee more important than distance</li>
                    <li>Avoid Stroke bunker at all costs</li>
                    <li>Green is shared with the 6th hole</li>
                    <li>Consider running approach using right-to-left slope</li>
                    <li>Watch for players crossing from 6th hole</li>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>The Stroke bunker earned its name from the countless strokes it has added to players' scores 
                over the centuries. Its strategic placement demonstrates the Old Course's emphasis on position 
                over power, a principle that has influenced golf course design worldwide.</p>
