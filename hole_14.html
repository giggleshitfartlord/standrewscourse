                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Aptly named "Long," this is one of the most challenging par 5s in championship golf. The hole 
                features the infamous Hell Bunker on the second shot, and the approach must navigate the Beardies 
                bunkers. A true three-shot hole for most players.</p>

                <h3>Historical Note</h3>
                <p>Hell Bunker gained its fearsome reputation during the 1933 Open Championship when Jos√© Jurado 
                took four shots to escape. Even modern champions have fallen victim to its depths, including Jack 
                Nicklaus who took three shots to get out during the 1995 Open.</p>
